This is the repo for *"Data Science in the tidyverse"* given at rstudio::conf(2018) in Jan 2018.

# Description

This is a two-day hands on workshop based on the book [R for Data Science](http://r4ds.had.co.nz/). This workshop is designed for people who are familiar with R and want to learn how to achieve their data analysis goals the "tidy" way. You will learn how to visualize, transform, and model data in R and work with date-times, character strings, and untidy data formats. Along the way, you will learn and use many packages from the tidyverse including ggplot2, dplyr, tidyr, readr, purrr, tibble, stringr, lubridate, and forcats.
